# Stock Analysis

## Overview
The pupose of this project was to create a tool within Excel using VBA coding in order to analyze stock volume and performance within a given year's timeframe. Further, it was necessary to refactor the VBA code to ensure the analysis was performed in a more efficient manner.

## Analysis
In order to perform this analysis, I first needed to understand the overall dataset. The data to be analyzed encompassed a collection of 12 stocks over the course of the years 2017 and 2018. Within this data, information was contained reflecting each stocks' performance details organized by ticker and date. Pertinent data to this analysis was the stocks' ticker, open price, close price, and volume.
